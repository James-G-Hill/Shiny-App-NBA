## View the App

You may be able to see the application at the following webpage:

[Shiny NBA Free Throws](https://james-g-hill.shinyapps.io/shiny-app-nba/)

Note that I do not regularly check the app is still available.
It should work but it is possible that the service providers stops it.
If the link fails then please contact me so that I can restart it.

## Development Setup

In order to work on this application locally you will need the dataset.
First, you will need to download the dataset from the following link:

[NBA Free Throws](https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws)

Then place the dataset in the 'dev/data/source_data' directory.
You will then need to open and run the `split_data.Rmd` script.
This will create the data in the 'dev/data/app_data' directory.

You can then test the app locally with the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
golem::run_dev()
```

## Changing Team & Season

The Stats tab has the team & season controlled by a configuration file.
This has been enabled to demonstrate the capability.
The file can be found at 'inst/golem-config.yml'.

The following options can be updated:

- `team` : A short code for the team
- `season` : A season in the format: 'yyyy - yyyy'
- `team_color_1` : A team hex color for the banner
- `team_color_2` : Another team hex color for the banner

Team colors can be found at the following link:

[NBA Team Colors](https://teamcolorcodes.com/nba-team-color-codes/)

## Running on shinyapps.io

1. Create an account at 'www.shinyapps.io'
2. Install 'rsconnect' package (`install.packages('rsconnect')`)
3. Follow the instructions for authorizing an account
4. Load the library 'rsconnect' locally (`library('rsconnect')`)
5. Deploy with `rsconnect::deployApp('path/to/your/app')`

## shinytest

I recorded a `shinytest` to demonstrate that I am capable of doing so.
However, recording this package & the tests with the finished package will fail.
There are 2 current issues which are beyond easy resolution:

- `phantomJS` won't record with the `esquisse` package loaded
- testing currently won't identify the `bs4Dash::sidebarMenu` id

The `phantomJS` issue maybe a result of that package no longer being developed.
The sidebarMenu 'id' issue seems like it should be resolved:

[bs4Dash Issue](https://github.com/RinteRface/bs4Dash/issues/8)

I was unable to get it to work even though the 'id' being available in app.
With further time I would investigate further & raise the second issue again.
